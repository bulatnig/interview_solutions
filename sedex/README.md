# Tax Calculator
 
The code and tests in this directory represent a part of a larger codebase.
You can build and test the code from the command line with:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
 
Opening the directory in IntelliJ should import it and allow you to edit and 
test it there. If it doesn't, please let us know before struggling.

Pretend that you have been given the task of extending the TaxCalc class in
some way. You're confident that the code is working, but maybe whoever 
wrote it didn't have time to make it as nice as we might like. You decide to 
make it better before getting on with the feature.

Feel free to convert the code and/or tests to Kotlin, or leave them in Java
if you're more comfortable there. You can change the interface and any of the 
types to make the code better. Obviously the tests should continue to pass, but
you can change them too.

We value correct, simple, expressive code, and hope that you can refactor
TaxCalc with these in mind. Please don't spend more than an hour on the task.

If other commitments mean that you don't have an hour to spend, please contact
us directly to see if we can adapt our hiring process.

When you're finished:

```bash
./gradlew done
```

will package up a zip file in `build/distributions` which you should return to us 
via whoever sent you here. If we like what we see and want to take things further
we'll probably work some more on the code as a pair in the interview.

PS - this is all a bit of an experiment. There aren't meant to be any tricks, 
so if something in the build or import etc doesn't work then please get in 
touch and let us know.

PPS - You may be tempted to introduce `BigDecimal`. We would rather you focused
on improving the structure and readability than the maths.
